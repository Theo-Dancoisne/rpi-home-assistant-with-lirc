Drop the lircd conf files of the remote controls you want to use with Home Assistant here.  
You can grab some in the [remotes database](https://lirc-remotes.sourceforge.net/remotes-table.html),
or create your own thanks to irrecord or mode2.

The common *`devinput.lircd.conf`* conf file is genereated in the container.
